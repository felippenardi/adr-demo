unit testing directives
* https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing - testing directives
  - is $_rootScope_ reference the ngMock $rootscope or Angular's $rootScope service?
    - figured it out.  ngMock decorates $rootScope so it has access to Angular's $rootScope service with extra features for testing
  - why is the module initialized in its own beforeEach statement?

* why do objects contain prototypes?
* why don't have to explicitly pass args to controllers, services, etc when implementing tests

* IIFE
  - should I be doing this at the file level or for each funtion in the file?
