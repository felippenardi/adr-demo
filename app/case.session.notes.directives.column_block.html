<!-- notes.notes should refer to adr.notes main controller -->

<!--

	Filters won't work because they return a new array.
	Instead, I have have some options...

	The first is to pass in all of the notes leaving it up to the category to display the relevant ones.  BEST OPTION.

	The second is to reorganize the way I store notes.  This would allow me to pass in the category's notes without using a filter.  I'm actually not sure if his will work because it may return a copy such that I won't be editing the orginal.  i.e.

		<category notes="notes.categories[block.contents.id]" ...></category>

		categories = {
			issues: [
				{note},
				{note}
			],
			facts: [],
			...
		} 

-->

<h5>{{ block.block.heading }}</h5>
<category 
	ng-if="block.block.contents.type == 'category'" 
	category="block.block.contents.id"
	notes="notes.notes">
</category>

<pre>{{ block.block }}</pre>
