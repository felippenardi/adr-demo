mv NotesCtrl data arrays with services

use resolve to load data from services in router
"
notesService.list().then(function(notes) {
    vm.notes = notes;
});
"

separate controllers from directives
- allows specs to be written to test each separately
- allows specs to inject controller mock into directive
- improves the readability of code

rm common.factories bec each service/factory should do one thing
- mv lodash service to lodash.factory.js

modify routing so that modules have their own routers
