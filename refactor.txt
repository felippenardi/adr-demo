place inline filters in angular filters
- inject lodash into these only
- notes.filters
  - linkModeNotesByPriorityAndThenTime()
- blocks.filters
- columns.filters

Automated Tests
use https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-ng-json2js-preprocessor for json fixtures in unit tests

ng-annotate
- add ng-strict-di directive to ngApp element so that Angular fails when manual injector annotations are not present - I will need to run ngAnnotate to annotate all of my files first.  This is what prevents my code from breaking once minified.

Gulp or Grunt
- ng-annotate
- jslint
- jsdoc
- minify
