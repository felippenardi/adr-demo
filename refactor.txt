place inline filters in angular filters
- inject lodash into these only
- notes.filters
  - linkModeNotesByPriorityAndThenTime()
- blocks.filters
- columns.filters

rm var modName = modual(...) because it clouds the global namespace

rm common.factories bec each service/factory should do one thing
- mv lodash service to lodash.factory.js

Automated Tests
use https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-ng-json2js-preprocessor for json fixtures in unit tests

ng-annotate
- use ng-annotate (https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate)
- use @ngInject since i'm separating classes out of angular declarations
- add ng-strict-di directive to ngApp element so that Angular fails when manual injector annotations are not present - I will need to run ngAnnotate to annotate all of my files first.  This is what prevents my code from breaking once minified.

Gulp or Grunt
- ng-annotate
- jslint
- jsdoc
- minify
